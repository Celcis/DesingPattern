We use the Strategy Pattern, when we want to define a class that willl have one behavior that is similar to other
behaviour in a list. When you need to use one of several behaviours dynamically.

Pros:
1. Often reduces long lists of conditionals
2. Avoids duplicate code
3. Keeps class changes from forcing other class changes
4. Can hide compicated or screet code from user

Cons:
1. Increased number of objects/Classes
